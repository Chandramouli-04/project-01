        <p>-->Notre-Dame is a famous Gothic cathedral located on the Île de la Cité in Paris. Built between the 12th and 14th centuries, it’s known for its twin towers, rose windows, flying buttresses, and gargoyles. It is a masterpiece of medieval architecture and a symbol of French heritage.
        In <b>April 2019</b>, a fire severely damaged the roof and spire. Restoration is ongoing, with plans to reopen by late <b>2024</b>. The cathedral was also made world-famous by Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.</p>
